## Openclassrooms project | Integrate a website template

![the template to integrate](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/sdz-upload/prod/upload/maquette111.png)

I developed this site as part of my training as a web developer on [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com).

It's a simple exercise to integrate a website template into html and css, without using a framework.

This is the showcase site of a fictitious web agency.
